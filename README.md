# Multimodal-Image-Captioning
In this repository, we will implement multimodal Image captioning using PyTorch
For this project, I have used Vision Transformer as the Image Encoder and GPT2 Decoder for textual data. THis is a Multimodal model (since two modalities of data: Image and Text).
Following is the architecture:

Trained this model on Flickr8k dataset.
The entire dataset (~8k images) divided into 80:20 ratio for train and validation data.
